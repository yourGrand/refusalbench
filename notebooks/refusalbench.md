## Abstract

Abstract The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document tasks while exhibiting dangerous over-confidence or over-caution.
Static benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances.
We introduce RefusalBench , a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs 176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty and three intensity levels.
Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks— RefusalBench-NQ (single-document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document), and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation of this critical capability.

## 1 Introduction

Language models deployed in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a critical challenge: determining when to answer based on provided context versus when to refuse due to insufficient or unreliable information (Kirichenko et al., 2025). This capability, termed selective refusal, is essential for safe deployment, yet current models systematically fail at this task.
Our experiments reveal that even frontier models correctly identify the underlying reason for refusal less than 50% of the time in multi-document scenarios, with some exhibiting dangerous extremes: refusing over 60% of answerable queries or confidently answering despite critical information defects.
These failures pose serious risks as RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where incorrect answers based on flawed information can have severe consequences.

Evaluating complex capabilities like selective refusal reveals a fundamental flaw in current benchmarking. These capabilities require recognizing diverse forms of uncertainty that resist simple pattern matching. Static benchmarks (Kiela et al., 2021) are ill-suited for this task, as models exploit dataset-specific artifacts and rapid model evolution renders them obsolete. We propose generative evaluation as the solution—a paradigm that programmatically creates fresh test instances through controlled perturbations. This approach not only prevents memorization but also ensures consistent measurement properties like difficulty and construct validity. This paradigm shift from static to dynamic evaluation is essential for tracking any complex capability where reliable assessment directly impacts deployment safety.

Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x1.png

We demonstrate this generative paradigm through RefusalBench, a framework that systematically evaluates selective refusal. Our system transforms answerable questions into unanswerable ones using 176 carefully designed perturbation strategies across six categories of informational uncertainty: ambiguity, contradiction, missing information, false premises, granularity mismatches, and epistemic mismatches. Each category includes three intensity levels, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model sensitivity. A multi-model generator-verifier pipeline ensures quality through unanimous consensus, achieving 93.1% human agreement. While we instantiate our methodology for selective refusal, the approach naturally extends to other capabilities. We release RefusalBench-NQ, RefusalBench-GaRAGe, and our complete framework, demonstrating how generative evaluation enables sustained measurement of complex capabilities.
Our contributions include:

- •
A generative evaluation methodology for contamination-resistant assessment (§[3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.SS1), §[3.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.SS4)). We introduce programmatic generation of evaluation instances with theoretical analysis proving superior long-term reliability and a multi-model consensus architecture ensuring quality at scale.
- •
A comprehensive framework for systematically probing selective refusal (§[3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.SS2), §[3.3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.SS3)). We develop a linguistically-grounded taxonomy of six uncertainty types with 176 perturbation strategies across three intensity levels, providing comprehensive coverage of refusal scenarios.
- •
A large-scale empirical study revealing the nature of refusal failures (§[4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.SS2)).
Evaluation of 30+ models uncovers severe capability gaps. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability that scales independently from answer accuracy, offering a clear forward path for building more reliable systems.

## 2 Related Work

Our work builds on extensive research in RAG evaluation, unanswerable questions, and model robustness, but introduces a new paradigm focused on the generative evaluation of selective refusal.

Teaching models to abstain when appropriate is a well-established area of research. Foundational work like SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018) introduced unanswerability in reading comprehension, while subsequent benchmarks targeted specific failure modes, such as ambiguity in AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) or false premises in FalseQA (Hu et al., 2023). More recently, a surge of work has focused on creating comprehensive taxonomies like CoCoNot (Brahman et al., 2024) and synthesizing unanswerable RAG queries with frameworks like UAEval4RAG (Peng et al., 2024a), RAG-ConfusionQA (Peng et al., 2024b), and ELOQ (Peng et al., 2025). Large-scale curated benchmarks like GaRAGe (Sorodoc et al., 2025) and AbstentionBench (Kirichenko et al., 2025) have been crucial in establishing that even frontier models struggle with general refusal capabilities.

RefusalBench complements these modern approaches by shifting from data curation or synthesis to a dynamic, linguistically-grounded perturbation methodology. While other generative frameworks synthesize new questions, our approach systematically modifies existing answerable pairs using 176 linguistic levers. This, combined with our use of controlled intensity levels, allows us to diagnose category-specific failures and characterize the sensitivity of a model’s refusal mechanism—a fine-grained analysis of epistemic calibration not offered by prior work. This focus is distinct from compliance refusal (Brahman et al., 2024) or mitigating hallucinations (Huang et al., 2025). For a comprehensive discussion, see Appendix [A](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A1).

## 3 The RefusalBench Methodology

To reliably measure selective refusal, we introduce a generative methodology designed to overcome the fundamental limitations of static evaluation. Our framework is built on three pillars: a formal linguistic taxonomy of informational uncertainty, a powerful perturbation engine, and a rigorous multi-model pipeline for quality control. The entire process, illustrated in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S1.F1), transforms any standard question-answering (QA) dataset into a dynamic and diagnostic benchmark.

### 3.1 Generative Evaluation: Theory and Advantages

Static benchmarks, which use a fixed set of evaluation examples, are ill-suited for tracking the capabilities of rapidly evolving models. They suffer from three critical failures: distribution drift, where the benchmark loses relevance over time; adaptive overfitting, where models are tuned to the specific test set; and test saturation, where the test becomes too easy to discriminate between top models.

The core challenge lies in the nature of the patterns models learn. While all machine learning involves pattern matching, the goal of evaluation is to measure a model’s grasp of generalizable principles (e.g., the logic of contradiction, the rules of syntax). A static benchmark, however, inevitably contains both these intended principles and spurious, instance-specific artifacts. Over time, models can learn to exploit these artifacts as shortcuts, leading to a form of test-set overfitting. Consequently, a high score may reflect memorization of the benchmark’s idiosyncrasies rather than the intended underlying capability.

Our generative paradigm maintains measurement validity by programmatically creating fresh, targeted test instances for each evaluation. To formalize this advantage, let $f(x)\in[0,1]$ denote a model’s score on instance $x$. We analyze the error when tracking the construct $g_{t}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}_{t}}[f(x)]$ over evaluation rounds. A static benchmark uses estimator $\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}$ based on $n$ samples drawn once from $\mathcal{D}_{0}$, while our generative approach uses $\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}$ with $m_{t}$ fresh samples from $\mathcal{D}_{t}$ at each round $t$. Define contamination drift $\Delta_{T}=\sup_{t\leq T}|g_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|$.

###### Theorem 3.1 (Measurement Error Under Contamination) .

Let $\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}$ and $\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}$ be the round-$t$ static and generative estimators based on $n$ and $m_{t}$ samples, respectively. For any error tolerance $\epsilon>0$:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\!\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq 2\exp\!\left(-2n(\epsilon-\Delta_{T})_{+}^{2}\right),$ $\displaystyle\Pr\!\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq\sum_{t=0}^{T}2\exp\!\left(-2m_{t}\epsilon^{2}\right).$ $$

The static bound deteriorates with contamination $\Delta_{T}$: when models memorize test instances rather than learning principles, $\Delta_{T}$ grows and the bound becomes vacuous once $\Delta_{T}\geq\epsilon$. Conversely, generative evaluation maintains consistent error bounds regardless of how models evolve. For RefusalBench, this ensures our perturbations continue to measure selective refusal construct even as models evolve. A full proof appears in Appendix [B](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A2).

###### Theorem 3.1 (Measurement Error Under Contamination) .

### 3.2 A Linguistic Taxonomy of Informational Uncertainty

While the generative framework is broadly applicable, in this work, we instantiate it for selective refusal based on informational uncertainty. We define this as the ability to abstain from answering when provided information contains defects that prevent a reliable response.
To systematically test this, we developed a taxonomy of six dimensions of informational uncertainty:

P-Ambiguity: Linguistic ambiguities that create multiple plausible interpretations, making a single definitive answer impossible.
(e.g., a "bat" being an animal vs. sports gear). Expected refusal: REFUSE_AMBIGUOUS.

P-Contradiction: The presence of logically inconsistent facts (e.g., revenue is both $10M and $12M). Expected refusal: REFUSE_CONTRADICTORY.

P-MissingInfo: The absence of a critical piece of information needed to answer (e.g., CEO name is absent). Expected refusal: REFUSE_MISSING.

P-FalsePremise: Queries built on a presupposition contradicted by the context (e.g., a non-existent "Mars division"). Expected refusal: REFUSE_FALSE_PREMISE.

P-GranularityMismatch: A misalignment between the requested and available level of detail (e.g., asking for city-wide "average income" with only two individual salaries in context). Expected refusal: REFUSE_GRANULARITY.

P-EpistemicMismatch: Queries requesting subjective opinions or predictions from factual context (e.g., asking "which painting is more beautiful?" given only their dimensions). Expected refusal: REFUSE_NONFACTUAL.

### 3.3 The Perturbation Engine: Levers and Intensity Control

The perturbation engine operationalizes our taxonomy through a catalogue of 176 distinct linguistic levers (with $\approx$10 levers for each of the 18 type-intensity combinations). Each lever is a specific instruction for modifying a query-context pair to introduce controlled uncertainty.
These levers were developed through human-LLM collaboration: domain experts authored the core logical conditions defining each lever, while OpenAI O3 (OpenAI, 2025), Claude 4 Opus (Anthropic, 2025), and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Comanici et al., 2025) generated instantiation examples that were accepted only when all three models agreed. A human expert validated all levers and examples to ensure correctness and consistency. This hybrid approach ensures both breadth across linguistic phenomena and depth within each category. Appendix [K](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A11) lists a comprehensive catalogue of perturbation levers.

##### Intensity Progression.

To enable fine-grained analysis, each perturbation category implements a three-level intensity progression that controls the severity of the induced uncertainty:

- •
LOW: Introduces subtle uncertainty that a competent model should resolve and answer correctly, testing for over-sensitive refusal.
- •
MEDIUM: Creates a clear informational deficit that necessitates refusal, testing the core selective refusal capability.
- •
HIGH: Presents a severe informational defect, often involving logical paradoxes, testing the robustness of refusal mechanisms.

The expected behavior is to answer correctly at LOW intensity and refuse appropriately at MEDIUM and HIGH intensities.

### 3.4 Quality Control: The Generator-Verifier Pipeline

Generating high-quality linguistic perturbations at scale is challenging. To ensure each test case is valid and reliably induces the target uncertainty, we implement a multi-model generator-verifier (G-V) pipeline (see Appendix [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A9) for prompts).

##### 1. Multi-Model Generation.

We employ $n$ distinct LLMs as generators $\mathcal{G}=\{G_{1},\dots,G_{n}\}$. For each base instance and target lever, every generator independently produces a perturbed instance, following detailed specifications provided in structured prompts.

##### 2. Cross-Model Verification.

Each generated perturbation is then evaluated by all $n$ models acting as verifiers. This cross-validation mitigates self-evaluation bias—the tendency of a model to approve its own outputs more readily. Verifiers assess each perturbation against seven criteria, including lever fidelity, intensity achievement, and implementation quality.

##### 3. Strict Consensus Filtering.

A perturbation is accepted into the final dataset only if it receives unanimous approval from all verifiers. This stringent criterion filters out ambiguous or model-specific artifacts, ensuring that every accepted perturbation is a high-quality test of the intended phenomenon. This G-V architecture achieves quality assurance at scale while maintaining the rigor necessary for reliable evaluation.

## 4 Experiments and Results

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

##### Benchmark Instantiation.

We create two benchmarks: RefusalBench-NQ, a short-answer RAG benchmark, and RefusalBench-GaRAGe for complex, multi-document RAG. The detailed curation steps for both are in Appendix [C.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.SS1).

RefusalBench-NQ is derived from NaturalQuestions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019), using ground truth passages from the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2020). We curated a base set of 100 instances by uniformly sampling from a pool of questions that all our evaluated frontier models answered correctly in their unperturbed state. This ensures that failures on perturbed variants are attributable to the introduced uncertainty, not the inherent difficulty of the original query. Following our G-V pipeline with a unanimous agreement filter, we performed stratified sampling to construct the final benchmark of 1,600 samples, balanced across perturbation types and generator contributions.

RefusalBench-GaRAGe is derived from the GaRAGe dataset (Sorodoc et al., 2025). We established a base set of 100 instances by uniformly sampling from a pool of human-validated, answerable questions from five domains on which top-performing models achieved a perfect RAF score. The same G-V pipeline and sampling yielded a final benchmark of 1,506 instances, which exhibits a naturalistic imbalance reflective of generation difficulty. Figure [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F2) shows the perturbation type coverage for both benchmarks, with generator contributions detailed in Appendix Figure [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.F12).

Figure: Figure 2: Stratified coverage heatmaps for both benchmarks. Left: RefusalBench-NQ demonstrates balanced distribution of 1,600 samples across all 18 perturbation types and intensities. Right: RefusalBench-GaRAGe exhibits naturally imbalanced distribution of 1,506 samples across perturbation types.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x2.png

##### Human Validation.

To audit the quality of our final datasets, an expert manually evaluated 180 randomly selected perturbations for each benchmark. The human pass rate for RefusalBench-NQ was 93.1%, and 88.3% for RefusalBench-GaRAGe. A detailed breakdown is available in Appendix [C.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.SS2).

##### Models Evaluated.

Our evaluation encompasses over 30 model variants.
The Frontier Models we evaluate include GPT-4 series (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o4-mini) (Achiam et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2025), Claude series (Claude-4-Opus, Claude-4-Sonnet, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) (Anthropic, 2025), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), and Amazon Nova series (Nova-Pro, Nova-Premier) (Langford et al., 2025).
To analyze the effect of scaling, we use Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B) (Dubey et al., 2024), Qwen 1.5 (0.5B to 72B) (Bai et al., 2023), and OLMo-2 DPO (1B to 32B) (OLMo et al., 2024).
Additionally, we compare SFT and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) versions of OLMo-2 and use variants of Claude-4-Sonnet with an extended thinking token budget.

##### Evaluation Protocol.

Each model was prompted to either answer or issue a specific refusal code. For RefusalBench-NQ, an LLM-as-Judge (Claude-4-Sonnet) assessed model outputs; a response was deemed a Correct Answer if it received a quality score of 4 or 5, and a Correct Refusal if it matched the ground-truth refusal category. For RefusalBench-GaRAGe, answer attempts were evaluated using the official RAF (Retrieval-Augmented Factuality) Score from GaRAGe, while refusals were evaluated using our category-matching logic. Based on these primary judgments, we compute a suite of analytical metrics to dissect performance, including False/Missed Refusal Rates, Refusal Detection F1-Score, Calibrated Refusal Score (CRS), and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). A comprehensive definition of all metrics is provided in Appendix [D](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A4).

### 4.2 Results and Analysis

Our investigation is structured around three key research questions (RQs).

#### RQ1: How effective is the generative methodology?

Our generator-verifier evaluation uses controlled comparison where we match perturbations across generators based on source question, perturbation class, intensity, and original context. Within this matched set, we preserve all verification outcomes without filtering, providing unbiased metrics of each model’s generation and verification capabilities.

##### Self-Evaluation Bias Validates Multi-Verifier Approach.

Fig [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F3) reveals systematic self-evaluation biases that justify our consensus-based quality control. On RefusalBench-NQ, models exhibit an average self-evaluation pass rate of 91.0% compared to 82.1% for cross-evaluation, with RefusalBench-GaRAGe showing similar patterns. Individual models demonstrate striking variations: Claude-4-Sonnet shows negative self-bias on both benchmarks (e.g., 75.7% self vs. 97.3% cross on NQ), while other models exhibit positive biases reaching +25.8pp. These findings, combined with poor inter-verifier agreement—$\kappa$ scores as low as 0.061 (Appendix Figure [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A4.F14)) demonstrate that models apply fundamentally different quality criteria. Thus, only perturbations achieving unanimous approval can be considered genuinely high-quality and model-agnostic. Despite these varying bias patterns, we observe a consistent generator quality ranking: Deepseek-R1 > Claude-4-Sonnet > GPT-4o > Nova-Pro across both benchmarks.

##### Perturbation Generation Exposes Model Strengths and Weaknesses.

Fig [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F4) shows a clear hierarchy in generation difficulty that holds across all models. Models universally excel at generating explicit logical flaws—achieving $>$95% pass rates for categories like EpistemicMismatch, Contradiction (NQ), and FalsePremise (GaRAGe). However, they uniformly struggle with categories requiring implicit reasoning, with Ambiguity and MissingInfo proving most challenging for every model tested (75-85% for top generators on NQ, $<$55% for weaker generators on GaRAGe). This convergence, where all models find the same categories easy or difficult, suggests these perturbation types tap into fundamentally different capabilities. Creating subtle ambiguities or strategically omitting information proves harder than generating explicit contradictions, providing insight into current model capabilities in handling linguistic nuance.

Supporting analyses in the appendix confirm these findings: model rankings remain stable across intensity levels, with HIGH intensity perturbations often easier to generate than LOW ones, and self-evaluation biases varying dramatically by task (Appendix Figures [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A5.F15)-[17](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A5.F17)).

#### RQ2: How can we characterize the selective refusal capabilities of current models?

Our evaluation reveals a pervasive capability gap in selective refusal. As shown in Figure [5](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F5), no frontier model achieves the >80% performance on both dimensions. The best refusal accuracy on RefusalBench-NQ is only 73.0% (Claude-4-Sonnet), and performance degrades catastrophically on multi-document tasks. Even the best model on RefusalBench-GaRAGe (DeepSeek-R1) achieves only 47.4% refusal accuracy, with Claude-4-Sonnet plummeting from 73.0% to 36.1%.
Selective refusal, knowing both when and how to respond, represents a fundamental capability gap in current systems.

Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x7.png

##### Refusal Comprises Two Distinct Skills.

Deeper analysis reveals that refusal comprises two sub-skills: detection (knowing *when* to refuse) and categorization (knowing *why*). Figure [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F6) shows that many models master one but not the other. On RefusalBench-NQ, GPT-4o’s high detection F1 is the result of extreme caution. It minimizes missed refusals (4.3% MRR) at the cost of being incorrectly refusing over 60% of answerable questions (Figure [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F22)). Its poor category accuracy (54.1%), shows it can identify but not understand informational flaws. In contrast, Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrates that both capabilities can be achieved simultaneously. This pattern also holds on the more complex RefusalBench-GaRAGe (Appendix Fig [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F18)) where the detection-categorization gap widens.

##### Severe Miscalibration but Better on Refusals.

To measure calibration, we modified prompts to elicit confidence levels. All models exhibit severe miscalibration, but as Figure [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F7) shows, they are better calibrated on refusals (ECE 0.226-0.519) than answers (ECE 0.406-0.580). Claude-4-Sonnet achieves the best calibration (ECE=0.286), though still poor in absolute terms. Reliability diagrams reveal that >73% of predictions occur at maximum confidence despite 40-69% accuracy (see Appendix [F.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.SS2) for methodology and Figure [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F19)).

##### Perturbation Type and Intensity Drive Performance Patterns.

Model performance varies significantly across perturbation types and intensities. Refusal rates increase monotonically with intensity from LOW to HIGH on NQ, confirming that subtle perturbations are hardest to detect. Different perturbation types show stark difficulty contrasts: REFUSE_GRANULARITY proves nearly unsolvable while REFUSE_INFO_MISSING is universally tractable. On all types, we find that models face a fundamental trade-off: the strong negative correlation (r = -0.78 on NQ) between false and missed refusals forces models to choose between being overly cautious or overly permissive (see Appendix Figures [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F20)–[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F22) for analyses).

##### Multi-Document Complexity Amplifies All Challenges.

RefusalBench-GaRAGe proves consistently more difficult than NQ across all metrics. Response distributions reveal that while wrong answers remain rare (<3.4%), missed refusals increase dramatically. Despite high eligibility scores (>91%) indicating models understand what users ask, variable RAF scores (83.4-95.9%) show they struggle to ground answers in the correct passages among multiple documents. Comprehensive performance dashboards confirm that no single metric captures model capability—high detection F1 doesn’t guarantee good categorization, and strong answer quality doesn’t predict refusal accuracy (see Appendix Figures [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F23)– [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F27) for details).

##### Systematic Misclassification of Refusal Types.

Figure: Figure 8: Average confusion matrices across all models. When models should refuse, they frequently misclassify the refusal type as *missing information*.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x8.png

Error analysis through confusion matrices (Figure [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F8)) reveals that models default to REFUSE_INFO_MISSING as a catch-all category. On RefusalBench-NQ, this category receives 25% of all predictions, and the most challenging categories REFUSE_GRANULARITY and REFUSE_AMBIGUOUS are frequently misclassified as missing information. Individual model analyses confirm this pattern persists across models and intensities, with multi-document contexts exacerbating the confusion (Appendix Figures [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F28)–[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F29)).

#### RQ3: What factors influence performance?

##### Effect of Scale.

As shown in Figure [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F9) on RefusalBench-NQ, answer accuracy and refusal accuracy exhibit distinct scaling behaviors. For answer accuracy, the Qwen family shows a critical capability emergence between 4B and 7B parameters, jumping from 13.0% to 56.1%. However, scaling patterns vary significantly: OLMo shows non-monotonic answer accuracy (peaking at 52.4% at 7B before dropping), while Llama’s answer accuracy slightly decreases from 8B to 70B. For refusal accuracy, patterns differ by family: OLMo shows monotonic improvement (5.1% to 19.3%), Llama improves 3.1x from 8B to 70B, while Qwen remains persistently low across all sizes (<17%). These divergent patterns demonstrate that answer and refusal capabilities scale independently.

Figure: Figure 9: Scale effects on RefusalBench-NQ. Answer and refusal accuracy show independent model-specific trajectories.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x9.png

##### Effect of Alignment Methods.

Figure [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F10) shows that Direct DPO significantly impacts both answering and refusal capabilities compared to SFT. For refusal accuracy, DPO provides consistent improvements across all scales, with the largest gain at 7B (3.4x improvement).
For answer accuracy, DPO outperforms SFT at every scale except 7B.
These results confirm that selective refusal is a trainable capability sensitive to alignment methods.

Figure: Figure 10: RefusalBench-NQ: Impact of alignment methods on OLMo. DPO improves refusal accuracy over SFT.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x10.png

##### Domain Specialization.

The task domain significantly impacts performance on RefusalBench-GaRAGe, where models exhibit specialization patterns (Figure [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.F11)). This is evident both in the variance of individual models, such as Nova-Premier’s 28.1pp range in answer quality across domains, and in the separation of skills: no single model achieves champion status in both answer quality and refusal accuracy within any domain. Average performance reveals a clear hierarchy of domain difficulty, with Business & Industrial proving the most challenging overall (see Appendix Figures [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F30)–[31](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F31) for detailed breakdowns).

Figure: Figure 11: Domain-specific performance rankings on RefusalBench-GaRAGe. Models exhibit specialization patterns across professional domains.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x11.png

##### Effect of Reasoning Length.

We find that inference-time reasoning has a negligible effect on Claude-4-Sonnet’s performance. Extending its reasoning trace with up to 4096 *thinking tokens* yields less than a 1pp improvement in refusal accuracy (Appendix Figure [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F32)).

### 4.3 Discussion

Our findings reveal that selective refusal is a critical, yet largely unaddressed, capability gap in state-of-the-art language models. Models fail in systematic ways: the frequent misclassification of complex issues as missing information suggests a shallow understanding of informational uncertainty rather than deep, principled reasoning. This is not a problem that can be solved by scale alone; our results show that refusal capabilities scale independently and often poorly compared to answer accuracy. Instead, selective refusal appears to be a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability. The superior performance of DPO-tuned models and the strong results from the Claude family—known for extensive refusal-oriented post-training—support the hypothesis that targeted alignment is the most promising path forward.

Measuring nuanced capabilities like selective refusal and tracking their evolution requires rethinking evaluation itself. Our generative methodology represents a paradigm shift from static benchmarks to dynamic assessment. By programmatically creating fresh test instances, our approach addresses benchmark obsolescence that undermines long-term capability tracking. Our empirical findings demonstrate that multi-model consensus is essential for reliable measurement, given the extremely poor inter-verifier agreement and significant self-evaluation biases across models. While we instantiate this framework for selective refusal, the methodology applies broadly to any capability requiring sustained, contamination-resistant evaluation. We hope our work serves the community as a reusable framework for tracking safety-critical capabilities as AI systems evolve.

## 5 Conclusion and Future Work

We introduced RefusalBench, a generative evaluation framework that overcomes static benchmark limitations through programmatic test generation. Our evaluation of 30+ models revealed severe deficiencies: frontier models achieve refusal accuracy below 50% on multi-document tasks, exhibiting extreme over-confidence or over-caution. Selective refusal comprises separable sub-skills, and is a trainable, alignment-sensitive capability that scales independently from answer accuracy. These findings offer concrete paths for improvement while establishing generative evaluation as a paradigm for sustained measurement of complex capabilities. Future work will extend this paradigm to other safety-critical capabilities, including reasoning, alignment, and factual grounding.

## 6 Limitations

While RefusalBench introduces a robust generative evaluation methodology, we acknowledge several limitations that define the scope of our work and offer avenues for future research.

Programmatic vs. Organic Complexity. Our methodology relies on systematic, programmatic perturbations to create unanswerable scenarios. While this ensures a controlled and principled approach to benchmark generation, these synthetic defects may not fully capture the organic complexity and subtle unreliabilities found in real-world information. These can arise from messy, incomplete, or implicitly contradictory sources that are harder to model with discrete levers.

Reliance on LLM-based Generation and Verification. The quality of our generated benchmarks is arbitrated by the LLMs in our generator-verifier pipeline. While our multi-model consensus mechanism mitigates individual model biases, it cannot guard against shared blind spots or biases common to all verifier models.
The risk of such systemic failures decreases as the architectural and training diversity of the verifier models increases.
Our strong human validation results provide confidence that this effect is limited, but it remains a potential limitation of any LLM-driven quality control system.

Linguistic and Modal Scope. Our current implementation and the released benchmarks (RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe) are focused exclusively on English-language text. The principles of selective refusal are universal, but their linguistic manifestations and the nuances of ambiguity, contradiction, and other informational defects can be highly language-specific. The framework has not yet been extended to other languages or to multimodal RAG settings where context may include images, tables, or other data formats.

Isolation from the Full RAG Pipeline. Our evaluation focuses on the language model’s ability to refuse based on a given context, effectively isolating the generator component of a RAG system. We do not evaluate the dynamic interplay with the retrieval component. A full RAG system’s failure modes also include the retriever providing irrelevant, insufficient, or misleading sets of documents, the effects of which are only partially simulated by our methodology.

## 7 Ethical Considerations

We developed RefusalBench to address a critical gap in evaluating how AI systems handle informational uncertainty. While our framework is designed to improve AI safety through better diagnostics, we acknowledge several ethical considerations that arise from this work.

##### Intended Use and Positive Impact.

RefusalBench serves as a diagnostic tool for the AI research community. By revealing specific weaknesses in how models handle informational uncertainty, our framework enables targeted improvements. The goal is developing models with appropriate epistemic humility, reducing confident misinformation propagation in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance.

##### Potential for Misuse and Benchmark Integrity.

We recognize two primary risks. First, our catalog of perturbation levers could be adapted by malicious actors to design adversarial attacks, aiming to degrade the performance or reliability of deployed AI systems. We believe that openly releasing our methodology will accelerate the development of robust defenses more quickly than potential misuse can proliferate. Second, model providers using our generative framework to create training datasets may achieve high RefusalBench scores through overfitting to lever patterns. While this is a concern, we emphasize that this is fundamentally different from the direct instance contamination that plagues static benchmarks. Unlike memorizing fixed input and output pairs, high performance on RefusalBench still requires a model to generalize its learned refusal skills to novel base data. Nevertheless, we strongly advocate using RefusalBench as intended for diagnostic evaluation.

##### Bias in Evaluation and Linguistic Scope.

Our framework operates on English-language corpora: RefusalBench-NQ uses Wikipedia passages via KILT, and RefusalBench-GaRAGe uses web-scraped GaRAGe documents. These sources may contain social and cultural biases. The analysis is English-centric, and identified failure modes may not generalize to other languages, as informational uncertainty manifestation is linguistically tied. As future work, we aim to extend this paradigm to diverse languages for globally equitable AI safety.

##### Reproducibility, Access, and Environmental Impact.

While bit-for-bit replication with proprietary API-based models remains challenging, we take concrete steps to maximize transparency. A representative benchmark subset is included in the supplementary materials with this submission, and all model versions and parameters are detailed in Appendix [J](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A10). Upon publication, we will release our full codebase and the complete RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe datasets. By releasing these artifacts, we enable the broader community to conduct evaluations and build upon our work without incurring the same environmental costs.

##### Data Licensing and Personally Identifiable Information.

We strictly adhere to source artifact licensing. NaturalQuestions and KILT, which form RefusalBench-NQ, are distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. The GaRAGe dataset, used for RefusalBench-GaRAGe, carries a CC-BY-NC-4.0 license. Accordingly, we release RefusalBench-GaRAGe under CC-BY-NC-4.0, restricting its use to non-commercial research purposes. The source datasets have undergone their own PII filtering processes, and our manual validation of hundreds of generated samples revealed no instances of sensitive personal information.

This section provides a comprehensive discussion of related work, positioning RefusalBench within the broader landscape of language model evaluation. We begin with a detailed comparative summary in Table [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A1.T1), which evaluates each benchmark against seven key features central to our work. The subsequent subsections then delve into these benchmarks in greater detail, categorizing them by their primary focus and methodology to highlight the specific contributions of our generative evaluation paradigm.

### A.1 Static Benchmarks for Unanswerability and Abstention

The evaluation of a model’s ability to *say no* has a rich history, moving from simple unanswerability to more nuanced scenarios.

##### Foundational Work

The effort was popularized by SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which introduced a binary answer-vs-abstain task for contexts where an answer span was explicitly missing. This established the baseline for evaluating refusal in reading comprehension. It was extended to more complex domains like scientific papers with QASPER (Dasigi et al., 2021).

##### Targeted Failure Modes

This line of work was extended to probe more specific reasons for refusal. Benchmarks like FalseQA (Hu et al., 2023) and (QA)² (Kim et al., 2023) created questions based on incorrect assumptions to test if models would correct the premise rather than answer naively. AmbigQA (Min et al., 2020) focused on questions with multiple plausible answers. Datasets like SituatedQA (Zhang and Choi, 2021) and FreshQA (Vu et al., 2023) highlighted that unanswerability can be a function of shifting temporal or geographical contexts.

##### Knowledge Gaps vs. Context Gaps

Some benchmarks test a model’s awareness of its own parametric knowledge limits. KUQ (Amayuelas et al., 2023) and the *Known Unknowns* task from BIG-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2023) test a model’s ability to recognize questions whose answers are fundamentally unknown to humanity (e.g., future events, unsolved problems). ALCUNA (Yin et al., 2023) uses a generative approach to create artificial knowledge to test if models can identify facts not present in the new knowledge base. WorldSense (Benchekroun et al., 2023) synthetically generates simple worlds to test logical consistency. This contrasts with our focus on gaps and defects within a provided, external RAG context.

##### Domain-Specific and Social Contexts

The importance of refusal has been highlighted in specialized domains. BBQ (Parrish et al., 2021) evaluates refusal to avoid perpetuating social biases in under-informative contexts. In the high-stakes clinical domain, MediQ (Li et al., 2024) explores interactive question-asking as a way for models to resolve uncertainty before committing to an answer.

While these benchmarks are foundational, they consist of static, fixed sets of questions, which can be memorized or overfit by rapidly evolving models, a problem our generative approach is designed to mitigate.

### A.2 Holistic Taxonomies and Modern Generative Approaches

Recognizing the diversity of refusal scenarios and the limitations of static data, recent work has aimed for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

##### Broad Taxonomies and Large-Scale Curation.

CoCoNot (Brahman et al., 2024) developed a broad taxonomy of non-compliance, covering requests that are not only unsafe but also unsupported, indeterminate, or incomprehensible. This was crucial in framing refusal as a multi-faceted challenge. The most comprehensive recent curation effort is AbstentionBench (Kirichenko et al., 2025), which gathers 20 datasets into a single, large-scale benchmark covering six abstention scenarios, providing a critical, holistic snapshot of the current landscape.

##### Generative Frameworks for RAG

A new wave of research focuses on generative approaches for RAG evaluation. Large-scale curated benchmarks like GaRAGe (Sorodoc et al., 2025) use generative methods to create complex, realistic questions to test a model’s ability to ground long-form answers in noisy, multi-document contexts, including a *deflection* subset for refusal. In parallel, other frameworks focus on synthesizing unanswerable queries from scratch. UAEval4RAG (Peng et al., 2024a) proposes a taxonomy and pipeline to synthesize queries for any knowledge base. RAG-ConfusionQA (Peng et al., 2024b) uses guided hallucination to create confusing questions. ELOQ (Peng et al., 2025) specifically targets out-of-scope questions where a retrieved document is topically relevant but lacks the answer.

RefusalBench builds on these motivations but introduces a fundamentally different paradigm. While the works above either curate static collections of unanswerable prompts or synthesize novel questions from documents, our linguistically-grounded perturbation methodology offers a third approach: starting with verified, answerable pairs and systematically introducing informational defects. It employs two axes of control: our use of systematic and controlled perturbations defines *what kind* of informational flaw is introduced, while intensity control defines the *severity* of that specific flaw. This two-dimensional approach allows us to diagnose failures with high precision, a novel contribution not present in prior work.

### A.3 Distinguishing Selective Refusal from General Refusal Capabilities

The capability we measure—*selective refusal*—should be distinguished from other related concepts:

##### Compliance Refusal

This typically refers to declining to generate content that violates safety policies, is harmful, or infringes on copyright (Brahman et al., 2024; Mazeika et al., 2024). Our focus is on epistemic refusal driven by informational unreliability, not policy adherence.

##### Hallucination Mitigation

Hallucinations are often defined as fabrications rooted in a model’s parametric knowledge gaps (Huang et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2024). While abstention is a strategy to prevent hallucinations (Wen et al., 2025), RefusalBench specifically tests this in a grounded setting, where the unreliability stems from the provided external context, not the model’s internal knowledge.

##### Verbalized Uncertainty

Research into verbalized uncertainty aims to train or prompt models to express their confidence levels directly (e.g., "I’m not sure") (Lin et al., 2022; Kadavath et al., 2022). RefusalBench evaluates the ultimate behavioral outcome—the decision to answer or abstain—and, in parallel, measures confidence calibration to see if a model’s stated confidence aligns with its behavioral accuracy.

## Appendix B Proof of Theorem 3.1 and Extended Analysis

We provide a formal proof for Theorem [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.Thmtheorem1), which characterizes how benchmark contamination affects the reliability of static and generative evaluation approaches.

### B.1 Notation and Formal Setup

Let $\mathcal{X}$ denote the space of all possible test instances. For a given model, let $f:\mathcal{X}\to[0,1]$ represent its score function, where $f(x)=1$ indicates a correct response (e.g., a correct answer or a correct refusal) and $f(x)=0$ indicates an incorrect one. The framework extends to any bounded score $f(x)\in[0,1]$.

At each evaluation round $t\in\{0,1,...,T\}$, the distribution of relevant test cases is $\mathcal{D}_{t}$. The construct at round $t$ is:

$$ $g_{t}=g(\mathcal{D}_{t})=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{D}_{t}}[f(x)]$ $$

The sequence $\{\mathcal{D}_{t}\}_{t=0}^{T}$ models how the evaluation landscape evolves—initially measuring the true construct, but potentially shifting as models learn to exploit specific test instances.

For a sample $A=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}$ drawn from a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, the empirical estimate is: $\hat{g}(A)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}f(x_{i})$.

We compare two estimation strategies:

- 1.
Static Estimator ($\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}$): Uses a fixed sample $S=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\sim\mathcal{D}_{0}$ drawn once at $t=0$. For all rounds $t$, the estimate remains $\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}=\hat{g}(S)$.
- 2.
Generative Estimator ($\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}$): Draws a fresh sample $B_{t}=\{x_{t,j}\}_{j=1}^{m_{t}}\sim\mathcal{D}_{t}$ at each round $t$. The round-$t$ estimate is $\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}=\hat{g}(B_{t})$.

We track the the contamination drift defined as:

$$ $\Delta_{T}=\sup_{t\leq T}|g_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|$ $$

This measures the maximum deviation between what the static benchmark originally measured and what it should measure at any later evaluation round.

###### Assumption B.1 (Fresh Sampling per Round) .

Each batch $B_{t}$ is drawn i.i.d. from $\mathcal{D}_{t}$, independent of all prior batches and their evaluations.

###### Assumption B.1 (Fresh Sampling per Round) .

### B.2 Proof of Theorem 3.1

###### Theorem B.1 (Measurement Error Under Contamination) .

For static and generative estimators with $n$ and $m_{t}$ samples respectively, and any error tolerance $\epsilon>0$:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\!\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\textnormal{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq 2\exp\!\left(-2n(\epsilon-\Delta_{T})_{+}^{2}\right),$ (1) $\displaystyle\Pr\!\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\textnormal{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq\sum_{t=0}^{T}2\exp\!\left(-2m_{t}\epsilon^{2}\right),$ (2) $$

where $(x)_{+}=\max\{x,0\}$.

###### Proof.

Part 1: Static Estimator Bound.
For any round $t$, decompose the estimation error using the triangle inequality:

$$ $\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|\leq\underbrace{\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})\right|}_{\text{sampling error}}+\underbrace{\left|g(\mathcal{D}_{0})-g_{t}\right|}_{\text{contamination}}$ (3) $$

Since $\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}$ is constant across rounds, taking the supremum over $t$ yields:

$$ $\displaystyle\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|$ $\displaystyle\leq\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})\right|+\sup_{t\leq T}\left|g(\mathcal{D}_{0})-g_{t}\right|$ $\displaystyle=\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})\right|+\Delta_{T}$ $$

Therefore, the event $\{\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\}$ implies $|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|>\epsilon-\Delta_{T}$.

Since $\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}$ is an average of $n$ i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{D}_{0}$, Hoeffding’s inequality gives:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq\Pr\left(\left|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})\right|>\epsilon-\Delta_{T}\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq 2\exp\left(-2n(\epsilon-\Delta_{T})_{+}^{2}\right)$ $$

$(\cdot)_{+}$ addresses the case when $\Delta_{T}\geq\epsilon$, where the bound becomes trivial (probability $\leq 1$).
This proves Equation [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A2.E1).

Part 2: Generative Estimator Bound.
At each round $t$, $\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}$ is unbiased: $\mathbb{E}[\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}]=g_{t}$. By Hoeffding’s inequality:

$$ $\Pr\left(|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right)\leq 2\exp(-2m_{t}\epsilon^{2})$ $$

The supremum error event equals the union of per-round error events:

$$ $\displaystyle\left\{\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right\}=\bigcup_{t=0}^{T}\left\{|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right\}$ $$

Applying the union bound:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\!\left(\sup_{t\leq T}\left|\hat{g}^{\textnormal{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}\right|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle=\Pr\left(\bigcup_{t=0}^{T}\left\{|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right\}\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq\sum_{t=0}^{T}\Pr\left(|\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\leq\sum_{t=0}^{T}2\exp\!\left(-2m_{t}\epsilon^{2}\right)$ $$

This proves Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A2.E2).
∎

###### Theorem B.1 (Measurement Error Under Contamination) .

###### Proof.

### B.3 When Static Benchmarks Fail

The upper bound in Theorem [3.1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S3.Thmtheorem1) becomes vacuous when $\Delta_{T}\geq\epsilon$ (it merely states that probability $\leq 1$). This raises a question: do static benchmarks actually fail under contamination, or does the theory simply lose predictive power? The following lower bound shows that static benchmarks not only lose theoretical guarantees but provably fail with high probability:

###### Corollary B.1 (Static failure under contamination) .

For any $\epsilon>0$:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\left(\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\quad\geq 1-2\exp\left(-2n(\Delta_{T}-\epsilon)_{+}^{2}\right)$ $$

When $\Delta_{T}\geq\epsilon$, the static benchmark exceeds error $\epsilon$ with probability at least $1-2\exp(-2n(\Delta_{T}-\epsilon)^{2})\to 1$ as $n\to\infty$.

###### Proof.

By the reverse triangle inequality:

$$ $\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}|\geq\Delta_{T}-|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|$ $$

Thus $\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}|\leq\epsilon$ requires $|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|\geq\Delta_{T}-\epsilon$. By Hoeffding:

$$ $\displaystyle\Pr\left(\sup_{t\leq T}|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g_{t}|>\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\quad\geq 1-\Pr\left(|\hat{g}^{\text{stat}}_{t}-g(\mathcal{D}_{0})|\geq\Delta_{T}-\epsilon\right)$ $\displaystyle\quad\geq 1-2\exp\left(-2n(\Delta_{T}-\epsilon)_{+}^{2}\right)$ $$

∎

###### Corollary B.1 (Static failure under contamination) .

###### Proof.

### B.4 Practical Implications for RefusalBench

##### Sample complexity.

For error $\epsilon$ with confidence $1-\delta$ over $T$ rounds:

- •
Generative: Requires $m_{t}\geq\frac{1}{2\epsilon^{2}}\log\frac{2(T+1)}{\delta}$ samples per round
- •
Static: Requires both $\Delta_{T}<\epsilon$ (low contamination) and $n\geq\frac{2}{\epsilon^{2}}\log\frac{2}{\delta}$ samples

The key insight: generative evaluation needs only fresh samples each round (easily generated programmatically), while static evaluation requires both a large curated test set *and* the unrealistic assumption that models never train on it. As contamination grows ($\Delta_{T}$ increases), static benchmarks become fundamentally unreliable regardless of sample size.

##### Implementation in RefusalBench.

The RefusalBench framework puts this theory into practice through three key design principles:

- 1.
Procedural Distribution Definition. The evaluation distribution $\mathcal{D}_{t}$ is defined as a *generative process*—the application of our 176 perturbation functions—rather than a static dataset. This structurally mitigates the contamination drift that degrades static benchmarks.
- 2.
On-Demand Sample Generation. For each evaluation, we compute the generative estimator $\hat{g}^{\text{gen}}_{t}$ by drawing a fresh, i.i.d. sample, satisfying the sampling assumptions required for its favorable concentration bound.
- 3.
Construct-Valid Perturbations. Our perturbations are designed with a clear ground-truth mapping (e.g., a contradiction requires a refusal), ensuring that the score function $f(x)$ validly measures the intended selective refusal construct, $g_{t}$.

Our methodology leverages the stable error bound of the generative estimator (Equation [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A2.E2)), which, unlike its static counterpart, is not degraded by contamination.

## Appendix C Benchmark Construction and Validation

### C.1 Detailed Benchmark Construction

This section details the criteria used to construct the base sets for our benchmarks before the perturbation process.

##### RefusalBench-NQ Base Set Curation.

The base set for RefusalBench-NQ was designed to model a standard short-answer RAG scenario where a question is answerable from a single, provided context. We started with questions from the NaturalQuestions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and used their corresponding ground truth Wikipedia passages as curated by the KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2020). We created a candidate pool by filtering for instances where: (1) the passage contained at least one official short answer, and (2) all our frontier models answered the question correctly. From this candidate pool of demonstrably solvable instances, we uniformly sampled 100 to form our final base set. This pre-testing methodology ensures that the original questions are not confounding variables, thereby isolating the evaluation to the model’s handling of the introduced perturbations.

##### RefusalBench-GaRAGe Base Set Curation.

The base set for RefusalBench-GaRAGe was designed to model a realistic yet controlled multi-document RAG scenario. We derived it from the GaRAGe dataset (Sorodoc et al., 2025) by first creating a candidate pool of high-quality instances. This involved filtering for questions that were: (1) human-validated and confirmed as answerable; (2) temporally stable and of low-to-moderate complexity; (3) grounded in a document set containing at least 10 passages to allow for sampling; and (4) demonstrably solvable, with leading frontier models achieving a perfect 1.0 RAF score.

From this candidate pool, we uniformly sampled 20 instances from each of five target domains (Science, Health, Business & Industrial, Law & Government, and Finance) to create our 100-instance base set. For each selected instance, we then normalized its context to a fixed size of 10 total passages. The composition was determined by selecting up to 5 of the most relevant *signal* passages prioritizing those cited in the original human answer, and filling the remaining slots with the most relevant *noise* passages to reach the total of 10. This process isolates the refusal construct by standardizing both question difficulty and total context size, thereby testing a model’s ability to ground its response amidst distractors.

### C.2 Human Validation

To audit the final quality of our benchmarks, we conducted a human validation study on instances that had already passed our full generator-verifier (G-V) pipeline with unanimous agreement. This step serves as an external audit to confirm the effectiveness of our automated quality control.

A single expert annotator with expertise in computational linguistics, evaluated a stratified random sample of 180 perturbations for each benchmark (10 from each of the 18 perturbation class-intensity combinations). The annotator consented to the task with full knowledge that the results would be used for quality assessment in this publication, and their evaluation was governed by the detailed rubric presented below.

As shown in Table [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.T2), the high human pass rates, 93.1% for RefusalBench-NQ and 88.3% for the more complex RefusalBench-GaRAGe confirm that our automated G-V pipeline is highly effective at producing valid test cases.

**Table 2: Human validation pass rates per perturbation class, based on a stratified random sample of 180 instances per benchmark.**
| Perturbation Class | NQ Pass Rate | GaRAGe Pass Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P-Ambiguity | 88.3% | 83.3% |
| P-Contradiction | 96.7% | 93.3% |
| P-EpistemicMismatch | 96.7% | 90.0% |
| P-FalsePremise | 93.3% | 90.0% |
| P-GranularityMismatch | 90.0% | 86.7% |
| P-MissingInfo | 93.3% | 86.7% |
| Average | 93.1% | 88.3% |

### C.3 Benchmark Composition Details

The final composition of each benchmark is a direct outcome of our curation strategy and the selective pressures of the unanimous verification filter.

##### Generator Contributions (Figure 12 ).

The contributions of our four generator models reveal important characteristics of each benchmark. For RefusalBench-NQ (Figure [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.F12)a), the final dataset contains exactly 400 samples from each generator. This perfect balance was enforced during sampling to eliminate any potential bias from a single generator’s style.

For RefusalBench-GaRAGe (Figure [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.F12)b), the contributions are imbalanced, reflecting the higher difficulty of the perturbation task. The final counts (Claude: 406, Deepseek: 385, GPT: 370, Nova: 345) are a direct result of the unanimous verification filter. The final contribution of each generator reflects its success rate in passing this stringent filter across all perturbation types. Consequently, the observed imbalance—for instance, Nova’s higher proportion of contributions to the more P-FalsePremise category—indicates that its generations for these tasks were more consistently deemed high-quality by the verifier consensus than its attempts on more complex perturbation classes like P-Ambiguity. This provides a view of generator capabilities under strict quality constraints.

##### Domain Distribution for RefusalBench-GaRAGe

The final RefusalBench-GaRAGe benchmark is well-distributed across the five domains selected during curation. As shown in Figure [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A3.F13), the domains have comparable representation, with the largest (Health, 22.9%) and smallest (Finance, 16.4%) differing by only  6.5 percentage points. This balanced distribution ensures that overall benchmark performance is not disproportionately skewed by model performance on any single subject area.

## Appendix D Detailed Evaluation Metrics

This section provides comprehensive definitions of all metrics employed in our evaluation protocol.

##### Benchmark-Specific Scoring.

We tailor our correctness judgments to each benchmark’s specific format and requirements.

- •
RefusalBench-NQ Scoring: An LLM-as-Judge classifies each response as either an *answer attempt* or a *refusal*. For answerable instances, answer attempts receive an Answer Quality Score on a 1–5 scale, where scores $\geq 4$ constitute correct answers. For unanswerable instances, refusals are deemed correct when their predicted category matches the ground-truth category.
- •
RefusalBench-GaRAGe Scoring: We employ a hybrid evaluation protocol. For unanswerable instances, we determine correctness through category matching, following the NQ approach. For answerable instances, we assess response quality using the GaRAGe framework’s LLM-as-Judge, which computes three key metrics: (i) Eligibility Score—a binary measure of intent satisfaction; (ii) Unadjusted Factuality Score—a binary measure of support from the complete 10-passage context; and (iii) RAF (Relevance-Aware Factuality) Score. The RAF score serves as our primary correctness metric, equaling 1 if and only if the response satisfies eligibility (Eligibility = 1) and all claims are supported exclusively by pre-identified relevant passages. We consider responses correct only when RAF = 1.

##### Core Behavioral Metrics.

The following metrics are derived from the primary judgments described above.

- •
Answer Accuracy (for RefusalBench-NQ): The proportion of all answerable instances that are correctly answered. To be counted as correct, the model must both choose to answer and provide an answer with a quality score of 4 or 5.
- •
Answer Quality Score (for RefusalBench-GaRAGe): The mean RAF Score calculated over all answerable instances. This serves as the continuous-score equivalent of Answer Accuracy. Instances where the model incorrectly refuses to answer are assigned an RAF Score of 0.
- •
Refusal Accuracy: The proportion of unanswerable instances correctly refused with appropriate categorization.
- •
False Refusal Rate (FRR): The proportion of answerable instances incorrectly refused, measuring over-cautious behavior.
- •
Missed Refusal Rate (MRR): The proportion of unanswerable instances incorrectly answered, measuring potentially harmful over-confidence.
- •
Refusal Rate: The overall percentage of responses classified as refusals, regardless of correctness.
- •
Correct Refusal Rate: The percentage of unanswerable questions where the model refuses to answer.

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x15.png

##### Other Refusal Analysis Metrics.

To analyze refusal behavior comprehensively, we employ metrics that distinguish between the decision to refuse and the reasoning underlying that decision.

- •
Refusal Detection F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall for the binary classification task of determining whether to refuse, measuring the model’s ability to identify when refusal is appropriate.
- •
Category Accuracy: Given correct refusal decisions, this metric evaluates the accuracy of predicted refusal reasons, assessing the quality of refusal reasoning.
- •
Hierarchical Refusal Score: The product of Detection F1-Score and Category Accuracy, providing a composite metric that rewards proficiency in both detection and categorization.

##### Composite and Calibration Metrics.

- •
Calibrated Refusal Score (CRS): Our primary balanced metric, computed as the arithmetic mean of Answer Accuracy and Refusal Accuracy.
- •
Hybrid Score (GaRAGe): A weighted composite score combining performance on answerable instances (RAF Score) and unanswerable instances (Refusal Accuracy), with weights proportional to their dataset representation.
- •

## Appendix E Extended Generator-Verifier Analysis (Supporting RQ1)

This section provides detailed analysis of our generator-verifier pipeline across both RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe, supporting the findings in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.SS2.SSSx1).

### E.1 Inter-Verifier Agreement Analysis

Figure [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A4.F14) presents Cohen’s Kappa scores measuring pairwise agreement between verifiers. The 4$\times$4 matrices reveal fundamentally different agreement patterns between benchmarks.

RefusalBench-NQ exhibits Kappa scores ranging from 0.061 to 0.442, with mean off-diagonal agreement of 0.190. While indicating poor overall agreement ($\kappa<$0.40 threshold), these scores suggest minimal shared evaluation criteria exist. The highest agreement ($\kappa$=0.442) between GPT-4o and Nova-Pro barely reaches moderate agreement, while the lowest ($\kappa$=0.061) between GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet indicates near-independent judgments.

RefusalBench-GaRAGe demonstrates markedly poorer agreement, with calculable scores ranging from 0.116 to 0.230. Nova-Pro’s agreement scores appear as NA (not applicable) in the matrix because it approves virtually all perturbations, providing insufficient variance for meaningful kappa calculation. The highest GaRAGe agreement ($\kappa$=0.230 between Claude-4-Sonnet and Deepseek-R1) remains far below typically acceptable thresholds for agreement.

The disparity between benchmarks suggests that increased task complexity in multi-document settings exacerbates evaluator disagreement. These findings strongly validate our unanimous consensus requirement: relying on any single verifier would produce results dominated by that model’s idiosyncratic biases.

### E.2 Generator Performance across Intensity Levels

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x19.png

Figure [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A5.F15) examines how generator performance varies across intensity levels.
Model rankings remain remarkably stable across intensities on both benchmarks. For RefusalBench-NQ, Deepseek-R1 consistently leads (91.0% LOW, 94.9% MEDIUM, 96.5% HIGH), while Nova-Pro consistently lags (71.1%, 69.0%, 73.9%). This $\sim$20pp performance gap persists across all intensity levels. RefusalBench-GaRAGe shows parallel patterns with slightly compressed ranges due to increased task complexity.

Surprisingly, pass rates often increase from LOW to HIGH intensity. This is because HIGH intensity perturbations require obvious, explicit flaws, while LOW intensity demands subtle modifications that maintain plausibility—a more challenging generative task.

GPT-4o exhibits non-monotonic behavior across both benchmarks, with performance dipping at MEDIUM intensity (NQ: 82.7%$\rightarrow$76.5%$\rightarrow$79.7%; GaRAGe: similar pattern). This suggests particular difficulty with moderately complex instructions that balance multiple competing constraints.

### E.3 Overall Perturbation Class Ranking

Figure [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A5.F16) establishes definitive difficulty rankings through aggregate pass rates across all generator-verifier pairs.

For RefusalBench-NQ, pass rates span a 25.3pp range across six categories. Ambiguity proves most challenging at 72.5%, followed by MissingInfo (92.8%), GranularityMismatch (93.8%), FalsePremise (94.3%), Contradiction (97.2%), with EpistemicMismatch easiest at 97.8%. This clear stratification indicates that generating linguistic ambiguities requires more sophisticated reasoning than creating epistemic mismatches or logical contradictions.

RefusalBench-GaRAGe presents a similar 23.7pp range, but here Ambiguity (73.4%) and MissingInfo (72.5%) cluster together as the most difficult categories. The remaining categories follow as EpistemicMismatch (76.7%), GranularityMismatch (78.7%), Contradiction (89.6%), and FalsePremise (97.1%). The multi-document context appears to equalize the difficulty of Ambiguity and MissingInfo generation, likely because both require maintaining consistency across multiple passages while avoiding resolution through additional context.

The convergence of both benchmarks on Ambiguity as a fundamental challenge is striking. Despite different task formats and complexity levels, this category consistently requires more effort than other categories. Current models face inherent difficulties in reasoning about multiple valid interpretations and strategically creating unresolvable uncertainties.

### E.4 Detailed Self-Evaluation Bias Analysis

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x21.png

Figure [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A5.F17) reveals significant variation in self-evaluation bias patterns, showing that bias is not a fixed model property but varies by task type.

RefusalBench-NQ data shows Claude-4-Sonnet as the only model with consistent negative bias, rating its own generations at 87.99% while peers rate them at 96.73% ($-$8.74pp overall). This self-criticism remains consistent across perturbation types. Conversely, Nova-Pro and GPT-4o exhibit strong positive bias, passing 100% of their own generations while peers pass 84.43% and 91.91% respectively (+15.57pp and +8.09pp). Deepseek-R1 demonstrates shows minimal bias (99.28% self vs. 97.80% cross, +1.48pp).

RefusalBench-GaRAGe amplifies these patterns. Claude-4-Sonnet’s negative bias intensifies to $-$26.3pp (70.4% self vs. 96.7% cross), suggesting increased self-criticism with task complexity. Nova-Pro’s positive bias becomes extreme at +43.0pp (98.5% self vs. 55.5% cross), indicating severe overconfidence on complex multi-document tasks. GPT-4o maintains substantial positive bias (+20.0pp), while Deepseek-R1 shows moderate positive bias (+6.6pp).

Task-specific analysis reveals biases are most extreme for challenging perturbation types. Models show their largest deviations (often exceeding $\pm$30pp) on Ambiguity and MissingInfo categories. This task-dependent variation, combined with model-specific patterns persisting across benchmarks, definitively establishes that single-model evaluation cannot provide reliable quality assessment. Even models showing low bias on certain tasks may exhibit severe bias on others, necessitating our multi-model verification approach.

## Appendix F Extended Frontier Model Analysis (Supporting RQ2)

This section supports the findings in Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.SS2.SSSx2).

### F.1 Refusal Detection vs. Categorization on RefusalBench-GaRAGe

Figure: Figure 18: Refusal detection F1 vs. category accuracy on RefusalBench-GaRAGe. Bubble size indicates refusal volume. The detection-categorization gap widens compared to RefusalBench-NQ.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x23.png

Figure [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F18) extends the refusal sub-skill analysis to the multi-document RefusalBench-GaRAGe benchmark. The pattern observed in RefusalBench-NQ persists but with notable differences. The detection-categorization gap widens substantially: while Nova-Pro maintains relatively high detection F1, its category accuracy drops more severely than on the single-document task. Claude-4-Opus emerges as the leader in categorization accuracy despite lower detection scores, suggesting that multi-document contexts particularly challenge the ability to identify the correct reason for refusal. The increased scatter and lower overall performance across both dimensions confirm that multi-document complexity not only makes refusal decisions harder but also makes understanding why to refuse significantly more challenging.

### F.2 Calibration Analysis

##### Confidence Measurement Protocol.

We modified evaluation prompts to explicitly request confidence levels alongside all responses. Models reported confidence using five discrete levels: VERY_CONFIDENT (90-100%), CONFIDENT (70-90%), SOMEWHAT_CONFIDENT (50-70%), UNCERTAIN (30-50%), and VERY_UNCERTAIN (<30%). The following instructions were added to the standard RefusalBench-NQ evaluation prompt:

Figure: Figure 19: Reliability diagram for RefusalBench-NQ. The diagonal line represents perfect calibration. All models fall below this line, indicating systematic miscalibration.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x24.png

##### Calibration Metrics.

We computed Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as:

$$ $\text{ECE}=\sum_{b=1}^{B}\frac{n_{b}}{N}|\text{acc}_{b}-\text{conf}_{b}|$ $$

where $B=5$ confidence bins, $n_{b}$ is predictions in bin $b$, $\text{acc}_{b}$ is empirical accuracy, and $\text{conf}_{b}$ is the bin’s confidence midpoint. We computed ECE separately for answers and refusals to identify response-type-specific patterns.

Figure [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F19) reveals universal and severe miscalibration across all models. Claude-4-Sonnet achieves the best calibration (ECE=0.286), yet when expressing 95% confidence, it is correct only 68.5% of the time. GPT-4.1 shows the worst calibration (ECE=0.546)—its highest confidence predictions succeed at just 40.6%. Critically, 73-99% of all predictions occur at maximum confidence, making this miscalibration particularly problematic for deployment. Models rarely express uncertainty, defaulting to high confidence even when performance approaches random chance.

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x25.png

### F.3 Refusal Intensity Curves

Figure [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F20) reveals how models adapt their refusal behavior as perturbations become more pronounced. All models show monotonic increases in refusal rates, validating our intensity stratification, but their trajectories differ dramatically. GPT-4o exhibits extreme caution even at LOW intensity (62.8% refusal on RefusalBench-NQ), while o4-mini starts conservatively (17.8%) but reaches similar levels by HIGH intensity. The steepest gains occur at the LOW→MEDIUM transition (average 47pp increase), suggesting models have a critical detection threshold for problematic queries. Notably, some models plateau on the multi-document RefusalBench-GaRAGe benchmark—GPT-4o increases only 1pp from MEDIUM to HIGH intensity—indicating their detection mechanisms saturate despite increasingly severe perturbations.

### F.4 Perturbation Performance Heatmaps

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x27.png

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x29.png

The heatmaps in Figure [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F21) reveal a hierarchy of perturbation difficulty across both benchmarks. REFUSE_GRANULARITY exhibits the lowest performance across models with the highest performance reaching only 31.1% (Claude-4-Sonnet on RefusalBench-NQ). This indicates that detecting mismatches between query granularity and available context granularity remains an unsolved challenge for current models. Conversely, REFUSE_INFO_MISSING demonstrates the highest accuracy rates (76-98% on RefusalBench-NQ), suggesting models effectively identify when required information is entirely absent from the context.

Model-specific performance patterns emerge within this hierarchy. DeepSeek-R1 achieves 77.7% accuracy on REFUSE_FALSE_PREMISE in RefusalBench-GaRAGe, the highest performance for this perturbation type. GPT-4o attains 98.2% accuracy on REFUSE_INFO_MISSING in RefusalBench-NQ while scoring below 52% on all other perturbation types, indicating a highly specialized detection capability. The within-model performance range across categories varies widely, and spans up to 98 percentage points demonstrating that our perturbation taxonomy captures distinct reasoning capabilities and failure modes.

### F.5 Error Rate Analysis

Figure [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F22) reveals the fundamental trade-off between two types of errors in selective refusal. The grouped bars demonstrate that models adopt different strategies when faced with potentially problematic queries. On RefusalBench-NQ, GPT-4o represents the extreme safety-first approach with a 62.8% false refusal rate but only 4.3% missed refusals—it refuses 14.6 times more often than necessary to avoid harmful outputs. Conversely, o4-mini prioritizes helpfulness with the lowest false refusal rate (17.8%) at the cost of missing 21.5% of necessary refusals. The Claude family occupies a middle ground, maintaining false refusal rates between 32-42% while keeping missed refusals consistently low ( 11%).

This trade-off becomes more pronounced on RefusalBench-GaRAGe’s multi-document queries. Nova-Premier’s missed refusal rate balloons to 53.7%, failing to refuse more than half of unanswerable questions in its attempt to remain helpful. Meanwhile, conservative models like GPT-4o maintain their cautious behavior across both benchmarks. The inverse relationship with false refusal rates typically 2-14x higher than missed refusal rates—demonstrates that current models cannot simultaneously optimize for both safety and helpfulness.

### F.6 Refusal Accuracy Ranking - RefusalBench-GaRAGe

Figure: Figure 23: Models ranked by refusal accuracy (colored bars) and hierarchical refusal score (blue overlay bars) on RefusalBench-GaRAGe. The hierarchical score combines detection F1 and category accuracy.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x31.png

Figure [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F23) presents a comparative ranking of model performance on multi-document refusal tasks. Each model is represented by two horizontally extending bars: the primary bar (color-coded by performance) shows refusal accuracy, while the overlapping blue bar indicates the hierarchical refusal score. Models are ordered by refusal accuracy from lowest to highest.

DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest refusal accuracy at 47.4%, followed by Claude-4-Opus (45.9%) and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (43.7%). However, this represents a precipitous decline from single-document performance—DeepSeek-R1’s 15pp drop from 62.3% on RefusalBench-NQ shows how multi-document complexity degrades refusal capabilities. We additionally find while DeepSeek-R1 leads in raw accuracy, Claude-4-Opus achieves a marginally higher hierarchical score (50.3% vs 49.1%), indicating superior refusal categorization. The hierarchical score, which combines detection F1 with category accuracy, provides a more comprehensive view of refusal competence than raw accuracy alone.

A clear performance stratification emerges with three distinct tiers. The top tier (>43% refusal accuracy) comprises DeepSeek-R1 and the Claude family, demonstrating robustness to multi-document contexts. The middle tier (35-40%) includes GPT-4o (39.9%) and Nova-Pro (35.5%), while the bottom tier (<30%) contains models optimized for answer quality—Nova-Premier (27.9%), GPT-4.1 (27.8%), and o4-mini (26.2%). The 21.2pp spread between best and worst performers underscores the significant challenge that multi-document refusal scenarios pose for current models.

### F.7 Comprehensive Performance Dashboards

Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x33.png

Figure: (a) RefusalBench-NQ
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x34.png

The dashboards in Figures [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F24) and [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F25) reveal stark performance differences between single-document (RefusalBench-NQ) and multi-document (RefusalBench-GaRAGe) settings. On the single-document benchmark, Claude-4-Sonnet achieves the highest calibrated refusal score (65.3%) by balancing strong refusal accuracy (73.0%) with solid answer accuracy (57.7%). However, under multi-document complexity in RefusalBench-GaRAGe, even the best model (Claude-4-Sonnet) drops to just 51.7% calibrated refusal score—a 13.6pp decline.

When comparing detection versus understanding, we find that models can detect when to refuse—Claude-3.5-Sonnet correctly refuses 88.2% of unanswerable questions on RefusalBench-NQ—but struggle to identify why. GPT-4o for instance, despite refusing 88.4% of unanswerable questions, correctly categorizes only 54.1% of its refusals. This detection-understanding gap persists across benchmarks.

The multi-document RefusalBench-GaRAGe benchmark forces models into a stark trade-off between answer quality and refusal accuracy. Nova-Premier prioritizes answer quality (68.0%) at the expense of refusal accuracy (27.9%), while DeepSeek-R1 shows the inverse pattern (42.4% answer quality, 47.4% refusal accuracy). This forced dichotomy, which is far less pronounced in single-document settings, reveals that simultaneously reasoning about information across multiple sources while correctly identifying unanswerable queries exceeds current model capabilities. The universal performance degradation from RefusalBench-NQ to RefusalBench-GaRAGe—with every model showing substantial drops across all metrics—demonstrates that selective refusal in multi-document contexts remains challenging.

### F.8 Response Distribution Analysis

Figure [26](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F26) decomposes model responses into six mutually exclusive categories, revealing fundamental differences in error patterns across models and benchmarks. Incorrect or low-quality answers are remarkably rare—under 3.0% on RefusalBench-NQ and 3.4% on RefusalBench-GaRAGe—indicating that answer quality is not the primary challenge. Instead, the decision of whether to answer dominates model failures.

Three distinct behavioral profiles emerge. GPT-4o exhibits extreme conservatism with total refusal rates of 88.4% (NQ) and 92.6% (GaRAGe), but commits severe categorization errors—34.2% and 38.0% wrong refusals respectively, the highest among all models. At the opposite extreme, Nova-Premier and Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrate permissive behavior with missed refusal rates exceeding 32.9% on RefusalBench-GaRAGe, attempting to answer over one-third of unanswerable questions. Claude-4-Opus achieves the most balanced profile with the highest correct refusal rates (52.6% on RefusalBench-NQ, 32.2% on RefusalBench-GaRAGe) while maintaining moderate error rates in both directions.

The shift from RefusalBench-NQ to RefusalBench-GaRAGe amplifies existing weaknesses: missed refusal rates increase for answer-oriented models (Nova-Premier: 12.2%→37.6%), while wrong refusal rates remain stable or worsen for conservative models (GPT-4o: 34.2%→38.0%). Multi-document complexity primarily challenges the decision boundary between answering and refusing, rather than the quality of answers themselves.

Figure: Figure 27: Answer quality metrics for RefusalBench-GaRAGe on answerable questions only. Shows eligibility score (understanding user intent), unadjusted factuality (support from all passages), and RAF score (support from relevant passages only).
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x36.png

### F.9 RefusalBench-GaRAGe Answer Quality Analysis

Figure [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F27) analyzes answer quality on the subset of questions where models attempted to answer rather than refuse. Three metrics capture different aspects of answer quality: eligibility score measures whether models understand user intent, unadjusted factuality assesses grounding in all provided passages, and RAF (Relevance-Aware Factuality) evaluates grounding specifically in relevant passages.

All models achieve high eligibility scores (>91%), confirming they accurately interpret user queries. The relationship between unadjusted factuality and RAF scores reveals model-specific grounding strategies. Nova-Premier shows the largest positive gap (+3.9pp), indicating superior use of relevant passages over irrelevant ones. Conversely, Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibits a negative gap (-1.6pp), suggesting some reliance on irrelevant passages. GPT-4o achieves the highest RAF score (95.9%) but answers only 49 questions—13.7% of Nova-Premier’s 357 attempts.

The RAF scores range from 83.4% (o4-mini) to 95.9% (GPT-4o), with most models clustering between 85-92%. This relatively narrow range, combined with the high eligibility scores, indicates that when models choose to answer, they generally produce relevant, well-grounded responses. The primary challenge lies not in answer quality but in the decision boundary of when to answer versus when to refuse, as evidenced by the vastly different answer attempt rates across models.

### F.10 Individual Model Confusion Matrices

Figure: Figure 28: Confusion matrices for nine frontier models on RefusalBench-NQ at MEDIUM intensity. Darker cells indicate higher frequency. Diagonal cells represent correct classifications.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x37.png

Figure: Figure 29: Confusion matrices for frontier models on RefusalBench-GaRAGe. Lower diagonal values compared to RefusalBench-NQ indicate increased difficulty in multi-document contexts.
Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x38.png

The confusion matrices in Figures [28](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F28) and [29](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A6.F29) reveal systematic patterns in how models misclassify refusal types. REFUSE_INFO_MISSING acts as a universal attractor, receiving misclassifications from nearly every other category. REFUSE_GRANULARITY proves exceptionally challenging—even Claude-4-Sonnet achieves only 25% accuracy, with half of these cases incorrectly classified as missing information. When models do refuse, their classification patterns vary: GPT-4o concentrates errors heavily in REFUSE_INFO_MISSING, while Claude models distribute misclassifications more evenly across refusal categories. The RefusalBench-GaRAGe matrices show uniformly lower diagonal values, confirming that multi-document contexts make accurate categorization substantially harder.

## Appendix G Statistical Analysis Details

To assess the statistical uncertainty of our results, we employed non-parametric bootstrap resampling (n=1,000) to compute the standard error (SE) and 95% confidence intervals for all primary metrics. The variance was found to be low across most evaluations. For our main refusal accuracy metrics on both benchmarks, the standard error was consistently below 2.0%, justifying the omission of error bars in figures to improve readability. For example, on RefusalBench-NQ, the refusal accuracy for Claude-4-Sonnet was 73.0% with a standard error of 1.7%. Similarly, on RefusalBench-GaRAGe, the accuracy for DeepSeek-R1 was 47.4% with a standard error of 1.9%.

## Appendix H Extended Analysis of Influential Factors (Supporting RQ3)

This section provides additional data supporting the analysis from Section [4.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#S4.SS2.SSSx3), with detailed breakdowns of domain-specific performance and reasoning length effects.

Figure: Figure 30: Domain champion analysis on RefusalBench-GaRAGe. Top performers for answer quality score (top) and refusal accuracy (bottom) are shown per domain. No model excels at both tasks within any domain.

Refer to caption: https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390/x40.png

##### Domain-Specific Champions.

Figure [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F30) shows that models specialize across domains. For answer quality, Nova-Premier dominates with victories in 4 out of 5 domains, achieving scores ranging from 54.7% (Business & Industrial) to 82.8% (Law & Government).
For refusal accuracy, DeepSeek-R1 leads in 3 domains (Finance: 51.6%, Health: 51.3%, Law & Government: 51.3%), while Claude models win in others. The absence of any model achieving top performance on both metrics within any single domain demonstrates a fundamental trade-off between providing high-quality answers and appropriately refusing unanswerable questions. DeepSeek-R1’s refusal accuracy range (40.0% to 51.6%) and Nova-Premier’s answer quality range (54.7% to 82.8%) illustrate the substantial domain-dependent variation even within individual models.

##### Domain Difficulty Analysis.

Figure [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F31) presents difficulty scores where higher values indicate more challenging domains. For answering tasks, Business & Industrial proves most difficult, while for refusal tasks, Science is most challenging. Law & Government is the easiest domain for providing answers but remains difficult for refusals, while Science shows the opposite pattern—moderately difficult for answers but hardest for appropriate refusals. The overall difficulty ranking (averaging answer and refusal scores) places Business & Industrial as most challenging (0.634) and Law & Government as least challenging (0.528), with a 10.6% spread indicating substantial variation in domain complexity.

##### Effect of Reasoning Length.

Figure [32](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A8.F32) examines whether extended reasoning traces improve selective refusal. Testing Claude-4-Sonnet with 0, 1024, 2048, and 4096 thinking tokens on RefusalBench-NQ shows minimal impact. Refusal accuracy improves by only 0.91pp at 1024 tokens, then returns to baseline or degrades at higher counts. Answer accuracy monotonically decreases with more thinking tokens, from 57.7% to 56.1%. These results indicate that selective refusal performance is not limited by the length of intermediate reasoning steps.

Figure: Figure 32: Effect of thinking token count on Claude-4-Sonnet performance. Neither answer nor refusal accuracy improves meaningfully with extended reasoning traces, with slight degradation at maximum length.

## Appendix I RefusalBench Prompts

This appendix presents the prompt templates for RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe.

### I.1 RefusalBench-NQ Prompts

RefusalBench-NQ applies perturbations to single-passage contexts from the Natural Questions dataset. This variant focuses on testing RAG systems’ refusal capabilities in traditional question-answering scenarios with Wikipedia-style passages, using simple context modification and binary classification with answer correctness evaluation (measuring accuracy against reference answers on a 1-5 scale) for short-form factual answers.

#### I.1.1 Generator Template

#### I.1.2 Verifier Template

#### I.1.3 Model Evaluation Template

#### I.1.4 Judge Template

### I.2 RefusalBench-GaRAGe Prompts

RefusalBench-GaRAGe applies perturbations to multi-passage contexts from the GaRAGe dataset, incorporating both relevant and irrelevant passages to simulate realistic RAG retrieval. This variant uses class-specific application strategies and multi-metric evaluation combining GaRAGe scores (Eligibility Score for intent satisfaction, Factuality Score for support by all passages, Relevance-Aware Factuality score (RAF) for support by relevant passages only) with refusal classification, testing systems’ ability to handle complex multi-source contexts while maintaining appropriate refusal behavior for long-form question answering.

#### I.2.1 Generator Template

#### I.2.2 Verifier Template

#### I.2.3 Model Evaluation Template

#### I.2.4 Judge Template

### I.3 Template Variables and Dynamic Content

The prompt templates above use dynamic variables that are populated based on the specific perturbation being generated. This section details the key variables and their possible values.

##### Target Assignment Logic.

The modification target (MODIFICATION_TARGET) is assigned deterministically based on the perturbation class. P-FalsePremise is induced in the Query. P-Contradiction and P-MissingInfo are created by altering the Context. P-Ambiguity may be introduced in either the Query or Context. Lastly, P-GranularityMismatch and P-EpistemicMismatch target the Query-Context Interaction.

### I.4 Answer Constraints by Intensity Level

The perturbation generation process is governed by intensity-specific constraints that determine whether the perturbed instance should remain answerable or become unanswerable. These constraints ensure proper calibration of perturbation difficulty across the three intensity levels.

This section provides comprehensive details on the computational resources, models, and software packages used in the development and evaluation of RefusalBench. All experiments were conducted in June and July 2025.

##### Computational Infrastructure and Cost.

Our experimental pipeline leveraged both cloud-based API services and dedicated local hardware to maximize accessibility and computational efficiency.

Cloud Services: We accessed proprietary language models through three primary cloud platforms: AWS Bedrock(^1^11[https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)) for Anthropic, Amazon, and DeepSeek models, the OpenAI API(^2^22[https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)) for OpenAI models, and Google Vertex AI(^3^33[https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)) for Google Gemini models. To streamline API management across providers, we utilized LiteLLM(^4^44[https://litellm.ai/](https://litellm.ai/)) (v1.40.11) as a unified interface layer.

Local Hardware: Open-source models were deployed locally on a dedicated server equipped with 4× NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPUs. Model serving was managed through the vLLM inference server(^5^55[https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)) (v0.5.1), which provided efficient batched inference and memory optimization.

Resource Requirements: The complete computational pipeline and experimental iterations, encompassing data generation for both RefusalBench-NQ and RefusalBench-GaRAGe datasets as well as comprehensive model evaluation, required less than $10,000 in total computational costs. The entire evaluation suite was completed within one week of wall-clock time.

##### Models Evaluated.

We conducted evaluations across 30+ language models spanning both proprietary and open-source variants. For proprietary models, we used default hyperparameters (temperature=1.0, top_p=1.0) for all generation, verification, and evaluation tasks, with the exception of Gemini 2.5 Pro, which used temperature=0.1 for optimal performance. Open-source models similarly employed default hyperparameters (temperature=1.0, top_p=1.0). Table [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.10390v1#A10.T3) provides an overview of the primary models evaluated, including their specific identifiers and access platforms.

##### Software Dependencies and Reproducibility.

Our experimental pipeline is built upon well-established open-source libraries from the Python machine learning ecosystem. Core dependencies include:

Model Management: Hugging Face Transformers(^6^66[https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)) (v4.42.3) for model loading and tokenization, and Hugging Face Datasets(^7^77[https://github.com/huggingface/datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)) (v2.19.2) for efficient data handling and preprocessing pipelines.

Data Processing: Pandas (v2.2.2) for structured data manipulation and NumPy (v1.26.4) for numerical computations and array operations.

Reproducibility Commitment: To facilitate reproducibility and enable further research, we provide a representative subset of our generated datasets as supplementary material with this submission. Upon publication, we commit to releasing the complete codebase, full datasets, and detailed analysis scripts through a public repository, enabling full replication of our experimental results.

## Appendix K Representative Perturbation Lever Catalogue

The following table presents 90 representative linguistic perturbation levers from the RefusalBench methodology (5 examples from each intensity level across all 6 perturbation classes). These examples illustrate the systematic approach to generating challenging test cases across varying levels of complexity. The complete catalogue, containing approximately 10 levers per intensity level for each perturbation class, is available in the accompanying GitHub repository.
